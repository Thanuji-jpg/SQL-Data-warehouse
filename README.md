# SQL-Data-warehouse Project 
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
This repository showcases a SQL-based data warehousing project designed to demonstrate skills in data modeling, ETL processing, and query optimization using SQL Server. The project reflects best practices in building scalable and efficient data warehouse solutions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, making analytical reporting and informed decision making.

Key features:
Developed star schema with fact and dimension tables (Sales, Customers, Products, Date).

Implemented ETL scripts to load and transform data from operational sources into the warehouse.

Created optimized SQL queries for common analytics use cases (e.g., total sales by region, customer segmentation).

Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as the primary development environment.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
SQL Server / SSMS

T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

Star schema and snowflake schema modeling concepts

ETL via SQL scripts

ðŸš€ How to Use
Clone this repository.

Use the SQL files to create tables, relationships, and load data into your local SQL Server instance.

Run example queries provided in the /queries folder to generate insights from the data warehouse.
